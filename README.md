# Overview

This software tool analyzes Stock Market data from Yahoo Finance dating back to 2010.

I created this dashboard to quickly review and check stock prices with in selected years.

# Data Analysis Results

My favorite part of the software is the year slider at the top. I like this because you can fine tune and zoom into different events that might have an effect on the market.

# Development Environment

I created this using Visual Studio and with Dash as my dashboard library. Dash has a lot of great integrated tools formats of which is the built in graphs because Plotly created Dash.

This was developed in Python with a little mix of HTML and CSS creatively added in to help with styling.

# Future Work

I would like to add a compare functionality that would allow the user to pull up multiple stocks at once to see how similar companies preformed in the same time frame. It would be cool if the slider could affect both datafames at the same time.

I would also like to change how the dashboard looks. Many others were able to create really pretty pages but I could only find a few comments on how they did it. Maybe if I used Co-Pilot to help understand how to incorporate CSS better with python I could get something pretty.

I do also want to add a picture of a cat to the design to try and make it more friendly looking but I could not get it to show up. I have to learn more about the HTML tags in python.
